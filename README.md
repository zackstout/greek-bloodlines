# Greek Bloodlines
Using data from multiple sources (scraped from the web, copied from family trees, copied from my plays) to create an interface for learning about Greek mythology. Big thanks to [this site](http://www.ancient-literature.com/characters.html) from which I'm scraping.

Unfortunately, the scraped data officially obviates my human-labor of reading from the physical plays. Lesson learned.

- jQuery
- Cheerios (for scraping with Node)
