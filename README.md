# Greek Bloodlines
Using data from multiple sources (scraped from the web, copied from family trees, copied from my plays) to create an interface for learning about Greek mythology. Big thanks to [this site](http://www.ancient-literature.com/characters.html) from which I'm scraping.

## Built with:
- jQuery
- Cheerios (for scraping with Node)
